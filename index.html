<p> Camel </p>
<ul>
    <li>The word ‘camel’ comes from an Arabic word, when it’s literally translated, it means beauty. Don’t ever try and say that camels are ugly!</li>
    <li>Camels will not damage their mouths if they eat thorny twigs and other items which might cause injury to other animals.</li>
    <li>The world’s largest meal included a roasted camel. It was served at an Arabic wedding feast.</li>
</ul>

        <p> Flying Cicada </p>
        <ul>
            <li>They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.</li>
            <li>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.</li>
            <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>

            <p> Panda  </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The origin of the name panda is the Nepalese word 'nigalya ponya', which means 'eater of bamboo'.</li>

                </a>
                <p> Pigeon  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The word 'pigeon' is actually derived from the Latin word 'pipio', which means 'young bird'.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons have much better hearing than humans and can hear very low frequencies that we cannot. For that reason, they can often detect storms in the distance that meteorologists haven’t picked up on their radar yet.  </li>

                    <p> Teddy Bear  </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
                        <li>Winnie the Pooh was based on a real bear</li>
                        <li> Jackie Miley, from Hilly City , South Dakota , has the world’s biggest teddy bear collection. As of 2012, she owned 8,026 cuddly bears.</li>
